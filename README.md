# Arduino RGB LED

This project made with Arduino and coded in C++, let's you control a RGB LED bulb using 3 potentiometers. Each potentiometer corresponds to one color, being the leftmost one green, center one blue and rightmost one red. You can give different values to each of this potentiometers convining the three colors making the bulb a custom RGB color.
